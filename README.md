This web page highlights our favorite hobbies and interests, using basic HTML elements to display content and structure it properly. We also incorporated a table to showcase the benefits of our hobbies and added inline CSS styling to improve the visual presentation.

### Features:
1. **Basic HTML Structure:**
   - Proper usage of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
   - Meaningful title included in the `<head>` section.
  
2. **HTML Content:**
   - A heading (`<h1>`) for the title.
   - A paragraph (`<p>`) describing our favorite hobbies.
   - An unordered list (`<ul>`) with at least three items related to hobbies.

3. **Link and Image:**
   - A hyperlink (`<a>`) linking to a relevant website.
   - An image (`<img>`) representing our groupâ€™s hobby with proper attributes like `src`, `alt`, and `width`.

4. **Proper Formatting & Structure:**
   - Code indentation and proper tag closure to ensure readability and maintainability.
